### ACM Style Leaderboard

For scoring, we will use the ACM style leaderboard. What does that mean for you? 
* A team's score is based on the number of problems they solve.
* Ties are broken based on the sum of the time to solve the problems.
* Penalty points equal to 20 minutes are added to the time for incorrect submissions.
* If a problem is submitted but never answered correctly, neither the time nor the penalty points are applied to the score.
* **Teams are ranked first by the number of problems and second by the total time and penalty points.**

### Example 

**Team 1 solves three problems at:**
* 15 minutes
* 45 minutes after two incorrect runs (40 penalty)
* 150 minutes 
* **total time:* 250

**Team 2 solves three problems at**
* 10 minutes
* 40 minutes
* 175 minutes
**total time:** 225

**Conclusion:** Team 2 wins.

### Timing

The contest will start at exactly 10:00 am eastern and will close at 1:00 pm eastern. While the challenge is active, a teams will be able to look at the leaderboard to see their current position on HackerRank.
