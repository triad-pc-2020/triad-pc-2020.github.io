The following are the rules for the contest:

* Student teams can consist of up to 3 members.
* Each team will have a **team captain** who will register for the contest on HackerRank. Only **one** team member can be registered.
* There are nine problems.  You may solve them in any order.  The problems are **not** sorted by difficulty.
* Teams are allowed to use books and notes.  You will not find solutions on the Internet.
* In the event you feel a problem statement is ambiguous, you may request a clarification.  Read the problem carefully before requesting a clarification.  If the judges believe that the problem statement is sufficiently clear, you will receive the response, “The problem statement is sufficient, no clarification necessary.”  If you receive this response, you should read the problem statement more carefully.  If you still feel there is an ambiguity, you will have to be more specific or descriptive of the ambiguity you have found.  If the problem statement is ambiguous in specifying the correct output for a particular input, please include that input data in the clarification request.
*	The submission of abusive programs or clarification requests to the judges will be considered grounds for immediate disqualification.
